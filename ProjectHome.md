The Plethora Library is an attempt to compile behaviors as a easy-access toolkit in order to understand the emergent behavior of complex systems. Its based on some of the concepts of steering behaviors by Craig Reynolds implemented by Daniel Shiffman and Karsten Schmidt in processing. The toolkit has been expanded in order to comunicate with a terrain class that hosts indexical calculations like cellular automata and vector fields. The Plethora Library is a sub-library of toxiclibs, supporting an open source community in continous expansion. Please feel free to send me some feedback at jomasan@gmail.com and check out my video tutorials of processing at www.plethora-project.com.
